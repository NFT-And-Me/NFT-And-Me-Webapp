              Users upload their photo and press a button. It is as simple as
              that. Behind the scenes the program uses machine algorithm to
              style the picture, save it in a decentralized storage system such
              as IPFS and create an NFT for it.

              From it, one is able to show it to friends and family, give it as
              present, save it in their wallet for future purposes, in short,
              whatever the user feels like.

              The end goal here is to put a smile on people's faces. They are
              art and as living pieces of art they too are entitled to be an NFT
              and be immortalized in the annals of blockchain technology. This
              is a fun project and serves entertainment purposes.
